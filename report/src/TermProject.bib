abstract = {The collaborative filtering (CF) approach to recommenders has recently enjoyed much interest and progress. The fact that it played a central role within the recently completed Netflix competition has contributed to its popularity. This chapter surveys the recent progress in the field. Matrix factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing CF, are described together with recent innovations. We also describe several extensions that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and implicit feedback to extend models accuracy. In passing, we include detailed descriptions of some the central methods developed for tackling the challenge of the Netflix Prize competition.},

abstract = {Dive Into Python is a hands-on guide to the Python language. Each chapter starts with a real complete code sample, proceeds to pick it apart and explain the pieces, and then puts it all back together again in a summary at the end. Python is a new and innovative scripting language. It is set to replace Perl as the programming language of choice for shell scripters, and for serious application developers wanting a feature rich yet simple language to deploy their products in. This book is not for newbies, for wimps, or for dummies\&8482;. It assumes a lot about you: - You know at least one real object-oriented language, such as Java, C, or Delphi. - You know at least one other scripting language, such as Perl, Visual Basic, or Javascript. If you\&8217;re just getting started programming, that doesn\&8217;t mean you can\&8217;t learn Python. Python is an easy language to learn, but you should probably learn it somewhere else.
